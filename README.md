# PythonProjects
# BaseballStuff
I scraped baseball-reference for data and got other data from baseball-savant. I then combined the data and used a TensorFlow Machine Learning model to find correlations 
between runs scored and the collected data. Used Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Scikit, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
# QLearning
I took AAPL stock data from finance.yahoo.com and created a Q table based on the data. I made this based on the course Machine Learning for Trading found on Udacity. Used Pandas.
# SportUpdate
Partially finished web scraper to update different sporting events taking place on that day. Used Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
